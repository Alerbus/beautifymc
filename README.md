Download and run each pack file to install (files can be found above, click on each and press Download)

Once all packs have been installed, go to Settings > Global Resources > My Packs

Click on each of the packs and press Activate

Go to Active

Put the packs in this order from top to bottom: Fused's Lush Leaves, Deluxe Water Pack LC, Transparent Water Pack, Universal Pack, Minecraft 3D 256x. This can be done by using the arrows that appear by clicking on a pack

2 packs have settings that I'd recommend changing from their default: set Fused's Lush Leaves to Normal Birch & set Minecraft 3D 256x to Flat Items. This can be done by using the gear that appears by clicking on a pack

Go back to title screen

Restart game
